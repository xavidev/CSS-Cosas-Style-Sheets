.gitignore file for a general web project - Bare Minimum Git
.gitignore
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# .gitignore
# Bare Minimum Git
# http://ironco.de/bare-minimum-git/
# ver 20181206
#
# From the root of your project run
# curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/salcode/10017553/raw/.gitignore
# to download this file
#
# This file is tailored for a general web project, it
# is NOT optimized for a WordPress project.  See
# https://gist.github.com/salcode/b515f520d3f8207ecd04
# for a WordPress specific .gitignore
#
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
# http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
#
# NOTES:
# The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not
# tracked by Git remain untracked.
#
# To ignore uncommitted changes in a file that is already tracked,
# use `git update-index --assume-unchanged`.
#
# To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked,
# use `git rm --cached`
#
# Change Log:
# 20190705 ignore private/secret files

Thanks for posting this as I was looking for exactly this gitignore file....switched from native java android coding to web and design and did not have an adequate gitignore setup for web projects

Please add a section for secrets (e.g. .pem, .key files etc)

@JohannesBe thanks for the feedback, this is a good idea

Off the top of my head it seems we should add the following

*.key
*.pem
*.der
